This is created in correspondence to **Task 5 : Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**.

Before we get into the report based on the packet capture , this packet capture was initiated after connecting to the network using ProtonVPN with `proton0` being the interface picked in Wireshark.

### **Network Traffic Analysis Report - Task 5: Packet Capture and Analysis**

**Date of Analysis:** June 2, 2025

**Objective:** To capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

**Capture Details:**
* **Duration of Capture:** 1 minute and 40 seconds
* **Active Network Interface:** `proton0` (indicating an active connection through ProtonVPN)
* **Traffic Generated By:** General web page Browse (searching various webpages) and executing `ping` commands in the terminal.

### **Protocols Identified and Their Roles**

Based on the packet capture performed using Wireshark, the following key protocols were identified and analyzed:

1.  **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**
    * **Role:** TCP is a fundamental transport layer protocol responsible for providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data streams between applications communicating over an IP network. It establishes and maintains connections.
    * **Observation Example:** TCP was the most frequently observed protocol in the capture, which is consistent with the web Browse activity undertaken. While web pages were loaded, no plain HTTP (Port 80) traffic was explicitly seen. All TCP traffic for web content was found to be encapsulated within TLS/SSL, meaning the actual application data was encrypted.

2.  **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
    * **Role:** TLS (the successor to SSL) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communication security over a computer network. It is widely used for securing web Browse (HTTPS), email, and other data transfers by encrypting the data.
    * **Observation Example:** A significant volume of TLS traffic was present, confirming that all web Browse activity was secured and encrypted. Both `TLSv1.2` and the more recent `TLSv1.3` versions were observed, indicating the use of modern secure communication protocols between the browser and various websites. This also explains the absence of cleartext HTTP packets.

3.  **Domain Name System (DNS)**
    * **Role:** DNS acts as the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.google.com`) into numerical IP addresses (e.g., `172.217.160.142`) that computers use for communication.
    * **Observation Example:** The capture included numerous DNS `Standard query` and `Standard query response` packets. Both IPv4 (A records) and IPv6 (AAAA records) queries and their corresponding responses were present, showcasing dual-stack network communication. DNS queries were primarily directed towards `8.8.8.8`, Google's public DNS server, suggesting that the VPN configuration might be routing DNS requests through this server.

4.  **Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC)**
    * **Role:** QUIC is a modern transport layer protocol built on top of UDP, designed to enhance the speed, reliability, and security of internet connections. It's the underlying protocol for HTTP/3 and aims to reduce latency and improve performance, especially on lossy networks, by mitigating head-of-line blocking.
    * **Observation Example:** The presence of QUIC packets was noted in the capture. This indicates that a portion of the web traffic (likely from modern browsers interacting with compatible web servers) was leveraging this newer, faster, and inherently encrypted protocol for communication, further contributing to the absence of traditional HTTP over TCP.

5.  **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**
    * **Role:** ICMP is a network layer protocol used by devices to send operational information and error messages. It is commonly employed by the `ping` command to test network connectivity.
    * **Observation Example:** As a result of running `ping` commands during the capture, distinct `ICMP Echo (ping) request` packets were observed being sent to `8.8.8.8`, along with their corresponding `ICMP Echo (ping) reply` packets being received, confirming successful network reachability to the target.

6.  **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**
    * **Role:** UDP is a simpler, connectionless transport layer protocol that prioritizes speed over guaranteed delivery. It's often used for services like DNS where quick, lightweight communication is preferred, and also serves as the foundation for QUIC.
    * **Observation Example:** UDP traffic was observed primarily carrying DNS queries (on Port 53) and serving as the transport for QUIC packets (often on UDP Port 443). This highlights UDP's role as an efficient, low-overhead transport for specific network services.

### **Summary of Findings**

The 1 minute and 40-second network traffic capture provided a practical demonstration of several core internet protocols operating in concert, all while the system was connected via a VPN.

**TCP** was the most prevalent protocol, serving as the underlying foundation for most established connections. Notably, direct **HTTP** traffic was completely absent. Instead, all observed web-related data was secured and encrypted within **TLS** sessions, with both `TLSv1.2` and `TLSv1.3` versions identified, signifying the widespread adoption of secure web Browse (HTTPS). The presence of **QUIC** packets further underscored the use of modern, high-performance, and inherently encrypted transport for certain web interactions, providing a faster alternative to traditional HTTP over TCP.

**DNS** traffic was crucial for name resolution, with queries directed towards `8.8.8.8` and encompassing both IPv4 (A) and IPv6 (AAAA) records. **ICMP** packets clearly illustrated the basic network connectivity checks performed by the `ping` command. Lastly, **UDP** was observed as the underlying transport for both DNS and the emerging QUIC protocol, demonstrating its role in lightweight, efficient communication.

The sheer volume and complexity of packets exchanged within such a brief capture period were striking, offering a tangible illustration of the continuous, layered communication that underpins even basic internet usage. This exercise provided valuable insight into the practical aspects of network protocol identification and the dominance of encrypted traffic in today's online environment.
