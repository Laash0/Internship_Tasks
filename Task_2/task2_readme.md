This file is made in correspondence to **Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample**.

**Phishing** is a type of **cyberattack** where attackers attempt to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, or other personal details, by impersonating a trustworthy entity in electronic communication, most commonly email. Attackers often use social engineering tactics in phishing to manipulate victims into taking desired actions, such as clicking malicious links or downloading attachments.

## Phishing Email Analysis Report 1

### 1. Sender Email Address
- **Email:** support@careerbuildcompany.com  
- **Analysis:** This is not a LinkedIn domain. Legitimate LinkedIn emails come from `@linkedin.com`. This domain appears spoofed or misleading.

---

### 2. Displayed Branding
- **Observation:** Mimics LinkedIn branding and layout.
- **Analysis:** Visual styling and elements are similar to legitimate LinkedIn communications, which may mislead recipients.

---

### 3. Email Content
- **Details:** Includes LinkedIn-style notifications:
  - "1 message"
  - "2 invitations"
  - "24 new updates"
  - "See what’s new" button
- **Analysis:** While the content appears familiar, the sender’s domain raises red flags.

---

### 4. Call to Action (CTA)
- **Text:** "See what’s new"
- **Analysis:** The CTA button may redirect to a phishing site. The actual link URL is not shown in the screenshot and should not be clicked without inspection.

---

### 5. Hyperlinks in Body
- **Observation:** Multiple links such as "1 message", "2 invitations".
- **Analysis:** These may lead to phishing sites or malware downloads, especially given the suspicious sender domain.

---

### 6. Language and Grammar
- **Observation:** No obvious grammar or spelling errors.
- **Analysis:** Neutral. Clean language doesn't confirm legitimacy.

## Phishing Email Analysis Report 2

### 1. Sender Email Address

## Recognizing Malicious Email Attempts

Identifying deceptive emails is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information. Here are common indicators to be aware of:

* **Examine Sender Information:** Pay close attention to the sender's email address and display name. Look for inconsistencies, misspellings of legitimate organizations, or unusual domains that don't align with the expected sender.
* **Analyze Email Metadata (Headers):** Utilize tools to examine the full email headers for discrepancies. These headers can reveal the true origin and path of the email, potentially exposing forged sender details or unusual routing.
* **Exercise Caution with Embedded Content:** Be highly suspicious of links and attachments. Always hover over elements that appear to be links to preview the actual URL without clicking. Look for mismatched text and link destinations, shortened URLs, or unexpected file types in attachments. Never interact with suspicious content directly.
* **Detect Persuasive or Coercive Language:** Be alert for urgent or threatening language in the email body. Attackers frequently employ social engineering tactics to pressure recipients into immediate action, often by instilling fear, curiosity, or a sense of urgency.
* **Identify Quality and Consistency Issues:** Look for spelling or grammar errors, awkward phrasing, or inconsistencies in branding or design. While some sophisticated attacks may be flawless, many deceptive emails still contain obvious mistakes that legitimate communications typically avoid.
* **Be Wary of Generic Salutations:** Be suspicious of emails that use generic greetings (e.g., "Dear Customer," "Dear Sir/Madam") instead of your specific name.
* **Verify Independently:** If an email raises any suspicion, do not use the contact information provided within the email itself. Instead, independently verify the legitimacy of the communication by contacting the organization directly through official and verified channels (e.g., their official website, a known customer service number).
